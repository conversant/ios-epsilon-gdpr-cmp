# IOS CMP TEST APP

This is a test app to show how to integrate the CMP widget framework into an application.

# Quickstart

```bash

# Test button functions
Show CMP --> Shows CMP **IF** the cmp did not show
Modify CMP --> Brings up CMP for changes
Reset CMP --> Deletes NSUserDefaults saved data
```

# Architecture

Super basic example. Not much architecture other then connecting the functions in ViewController to the UIButtons in the storyboard. It's a good starter step to getting an app created using our CMP.
